# Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas PS Vita Port

<p align="center"><img src="./screenshots/game.png"></p>

This is a wrapper/port of *Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Mobile* for the *PS Vita*.  
The port works by loading the official Android executable in memory, resolving its imports with native functions and patching it in order to properly run.

## Setup Instructions (For End Users)
In order to properly install the game, you'll have to follow these steps precisely:
* Install [kubridge](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/kubridge/releases/) and [FdFix](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/FdFix/releases/) by copying `kubridge.suprx` and `fd_fix.skprx` to your taiHEN plugins folder (usually `ux0:tai`) and adding two entries to your `config.txt` under `*KERNEL`:
  
```
  *KERNEL
  ux0:tai/kubridge.
  ux0:tai/fd_fix.skprx
```

* **Optional**: Install [PSVshell](https://github.com/Electry/PSVshell/releases) to overclock your device to 500Mhz.
* Install `libshacccg.suprx`, if you don't have it already, by following [this guide](https://samilops2.gitbook.io/vita-troubleshooting-guide/shader-compiler/extract-libshacccg.suprx).
* Obtain your copy of *Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas v2.00* (`com.rockstargames.gtasager` is not supported!) for Android in form of an `.apk` file and one or more `.obb` files (usually `main.8.com.rockstargames.gtasa.obb` and `patch.8.com.rockstargames.gtasa.obb` located in `/sdcard/android/obb/com.rockstargames.gtasa`). [You can get all the required files directly from your phone](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11012976/how-do-i-get-the-apk-of-an-installed-app-without-root-access) and they can be extracted with whatever Zip extractor you prefer (eg: WinZip, WinRar, etc...).
* Extract the `assets` folder from your `.apk` file to `ux0:data` and rename it to `gtasa`.
* Extract the file `libGTASA.so` from the `lib/armeabi-v7a` folder inside your `.apk` file to `ux0:data/gtasa`.
* Extract the whole `main.8.com.rockstargames.gtasa.obb` file to `ux0:data/gtasa`.
* Extract the whole `patch.8.com.rockstargames.gtasa.obb` file to `ux0:data/gtasa`.
* Extract [gamefiles.zip](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/gtasa_vita/releases/download/v1.0/gamefiles.zip) to `ux0:data/gtasa`.
* **Optional**: For a more authentic console experience, copy the file `ux0:data/gtasa/data/360Default1280x720.cfg` to `ux0:data/gtasa/Adjustable.cfg`. This file is a leftover from the Xbox 360 version and provides you the console HUD (e.g. radar on bottom left).
* Install [GTASA.vpk](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/gtasa_vita/releases/download/v1.0/GTASA.vpk) on your PS Vita.

## Configurator App
After fully installing the port, you'll be able to configure it with the Configurator app.<br>
The Configurator app will allow users to enable or disable a set of optimizations, patches and renderer alterations to best match users taste.<br>
You can launch the Configurato app by clicking on the `Configuration` button located on the Livearea section of the port as shown in the following screenshot.

## Build Instructions (For Developers)
In order to build the loader, you'll need a [vitasdk](https://github.com/vitasdk) build fully compiled with softfp usage.  
You can find a precompiled version here: [Linux](https://github.com/vitasdk/buildscripts/suites/1824103476/artifacts/35161735) / [Windows](https://github.com/vitasdk/buildscripts/suites/1836262288/artifacts/35501612).  
Additionally, you'll need these libraries to bee compiled as well with `-mfloat-abi=softfp` added to their CFLAGS:

* [openal-soft](https://github.com/isage/openal-soft/tree/vita-1.19.1)
* [libmathneon](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/math-neon)
* [vitaShaRK](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/vitaShaRK)
* [imgui-vita](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/imgui-vita)
* [kubridge](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/kubridge)

As last requirement, you'll need to compile [vitaGL](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/vitaGL) with `make HAVE_SBRK=1 SOFTFP_ABI=1 SHARED_RENDERTARGETS=1 NO_DEBUG=1`.  
After all these requirements are met, you can compile the loader with the following commands:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
make
```
